1. Hack away in master until ready to release

2. Update the script/archive.sh with the correct version TAG and commit this file
   Tag the master branch with the release: 
      git tag -a release/VERSION -m "VERSION message"

   Be careful not to make any more changes

   Run the script/archive.sh to create the tarball we want

2. Merge the code you want to release from master into upstream branch
	git checkout upstream 
	git merge master 

3. Merge the code from upstream in debian branch 
	git checkout debian 
	git merge master 

4. Build the package with: 
	debuild -us -uc
